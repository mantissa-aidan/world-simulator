# World Simulator

A simple world simulation written in Rust using the `ggez` game engine. This simulator includes agents of different types interacting in a 2D grid. Agents can move randomly, follow the mouse, chase prey, or avoid predators.

## Features
- **Agent Interaction**: Simulates predator-prey dynamics where predators chase prey and prey avoid predators.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Optionally allows agents to follow the mouse position.
- **Vision Cone**: Agents have a field of view that determines which other agents they can see.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time simulation with pause and resume functionality.
- **Googly Eyes**: Agents are visualized with googly eyes and a vision cone for added fun!

## Installation Instructions

### 1. **Install Rust**  
Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, download and install them from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### 2. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd world-simulator
```

### 3. **Run the Simulator**  
```bash
cargo run
```

## Setting up a Docker Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed. Get it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/).
- Docker Compose installed (usually comes with Docker Desktop).

### Steps

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`**  
   Add the following `Dockerfile` in the project root:

   ```dockerfile
   # Use the official Rust image as the base
   FROM rust:latest

   # Set working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Install SDL2 and other dependencies required for ggez
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       libsdl2-dev \
       libfreetype6-dev \
       libasound2-dev \
       libudev-dev \
       libx11-dev \
       libxrandr-dev && \
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

   # Copy project files into the container
   COPY . .

   # Install dependencies and build the application
   RUN cargo build

   # Set the command to run the application
   CMD ["cargo", "run"]
   ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`**  
   Add the following `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     world-simulator:
       build:
         context: .
       volumes:
         - .:/app
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
       stdin_open: true
       tty: true
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Container**  
   In the project root directory, run the following commands:

   - Build the container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose build
     ```
   - Run the container:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

4. **Access the Development Environment**  
   - The container is set up to mount your project directory (`.`) to `/app` in the container. Changes made locally will reflect in the container.
   - You can access the running container's shell for debugging:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
     ```

## How to Use

- **Controls**:
  - **`P`**: Pause the simulation.
  - **`R`**: Resume the simulation when paused.
  - **`Q`**: Quit the simulation when paused.
  - **`F`**: Toggle "Follow Mouse" mode. When enabled, agents move toward the mouse position.

- **Mouse Interaction**:  
  Move the mouse around to influence agent behavior in "Follow Mouse" mode.

---

## Customization

You can customize various constants in the `main.rs` file:
- `VISION_RANGE`: Adjust the distance agents can "see."
- `SCALING_FACTOR`: Set the size of the simulation grid cells.
- `GAME_SPEED`: Change the simulation update interval (in milliseconds).
- `AGENT_DRAW_SIZE`: Modify the visual size of agents.

## Dependencies

- [ggez](https://ggez.rs): A lightweight game framework for Rust.
- [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon): For parallel processing.
